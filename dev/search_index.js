Each bit is set to 1 if it is occupied by an electron of the given spin. In principle, the number of electron flavors and orbitals is free, however, for now it is fixed to 2 and 1.\n\nA list of states should be generated using States(NSites) with NSites being the number of sites in the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#jED.CDag_sign-Tuple{StaticArraysCore.SVector, Int64}","page":"Home","title":"jED.CDag_sign","text":"CDag_sign(state,i)\n\nSign when annihilating an electron at position i in state.
