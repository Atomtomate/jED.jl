# jED

Simple implementation of exact diagonalization for models such as die Hubbard or Anderson impurity model (AIM).
Defines overlap and operators which can be used to build up a model. Examples for the single impurity AIM are given in (TODO: name of file)

Most of this code is adapted from [sfED.jl](https://github.com/steffenbackes/sfED) with some minor changes to improve performance for simple models.
